# MBAI 417 : Data Intensive Systems
[[github link](https://github.com/drc-cs/SPRING25-DATA-INTENSIVE-SYSTEMS/tree/main)]

Welcome to Data Intensive Systems! This course provides a comprehensive introduction to distributed data processing and modeling.  These areas are essential to roles such as Data Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers, and Data Architects. The first half covers data-intensive operations including handling cloud storage, online analytical processing, and distributed data preprocessing. Building on this foundation, we transition towards data-intensive machine learning operations, including scalable machine learning algorithms (e.g. linear regression, XGBoost), distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, and model serving with real-time inference. These skills are essential for Machine Learning Engineers, Machine Learning Operations Engineers, and Technical Product Managers.

Assessments include two exams covering all material covered in the lectures and homeworks. Homework assignments focus on practical tasks processing large datasets and training machine learning models in the cloud, reinforcing learned concepts through real-world applications. These hands-on projects mirror the day-to-day work of industry professionals.
