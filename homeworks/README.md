# MBAI | Data Intensive Systems 
## Homework Plan

- [] Set up autograder to grade python scripts, similar to CS 326.
- [] Consider accompanying notebooks.

## H.01

- [] Python module for interacting with Boto 3 / AWS S3.

## H.02

- [] Python module for moving local data OR AWS S3 data to Snowflake. Add note saying that usually we would do directly from S3 into Snowflake, but for the sake of this homework, we will move data from AWS to local (using functions from H.01) to Snowflake (using new functions).
- [] Query SnowFlake using SQL.

## H.03

- [] Python module for basic OLAP operations in Snowflake.
- [] Python module with custom data pipeline in Snowflake (SnowPark Pandas API)

## H.04

- [] Python module to train a classification & regression model using SnowFlake data.
- [] Python module to tune a classification & regression model using SnowFlake data.
- [] Report on model performance.

## H.05

- [] Python module to serve a model trained on SnowFlake data. SnowFlake offers a SQL / Python / REST API for serving models.
